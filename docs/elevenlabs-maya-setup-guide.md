CONVERSATION STARTERS:
New User: "Hello! I'm Maya, and I'm here to help you get crystal clear on your goals. Welcome to LiveGuide! I'm curious... what brought you here today?"

Returning User: "Welcome back! It's Maya. [Reference recent work]. How's that journey going?"

KEY QUESTIONS:

const conversation = useElevenLabsConversation({
  agentId: MAYA_AGENT_ID,
  userId: user.id,
  customVariables: {
    userId: user.id,
    userName: user.name,

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue 1: Context Not Loading

- Check CORS settings

### Issue 2: Voice Sounds Robotic

### Issue 3: Responses Too Long
- Reduce max tokens to 100-150
- Add "Be concise" to prompt
- Use response length limits in prompt

### Issue 4: Not Referencing User History
- Verify RAG context is being passed
- Check knowledge context formatting
- Ensure webhook returns data
- Test with explicit context references

### Issue 5: Poor Goal Extraction
