# ElevenLabs Agent Implementation Guide

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Deploy Required Functions

```bash
# Ensure all edge functions are deployed
supabase functions deploy mcp-server --project-ref hlwxmfwrksflvcacjafg
supabase functions deploy elevenlabs-webhook --project-ref hlwxmfwrksflvcacjafg  
supabase functions deploy elevenlabs-init-webhook --project-ref hlwxmfwrksflvcacjafg

# Verify deployments
curl https://hlwxmfwrksflvcacjafg.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp-server
curl https://hlwxmfwrksflvcacjafg.supabase.co/functions/v1/elevenlabs-webhook

```

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Ensure these environment variables are set in your Supabase project:

```bash
SUPABASE_URL=https://hlwxmfwrksflvcacjafg.supabase.co
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=[your-service-role-key]
OPENAI_API_KEY=[your-openai-key]
ELEVENLABS_API_KEY=[your-elevenlabs-key]
ELEVENLABS_WEBHOOK_SECRET=[generate-secure-random-string]
```

### Step 3: Create ElevenLabs Agents

Use these exact configurations for each coaching agent:

curl -X POST https://hlwxmfwrksflvcacjafg.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp-server \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "tools/list",
    "params": {}
  }'
```

Expected response: List of available MCP tools

### Step 2: Test Webhook Endpoints

```bash

          "confidence_level": 0.8
        }
      ]
    }
  }'
```

### Step 3: Test Agent Conversations

Use this testing script:

```javascript
// scripts/test-coaching-agents.js
const testCoachingSession = async (agentId, testScenario) => {
  console.log(`Testing ${agentId} with scenario: ${testScenario.name}`);
  
  // Test conversation flow
  const conversation = {
    user_input: testScenario.userMessages,
    expected_mcp_calls: testScenario.expectedMCPCalls,
    expected_extractions: testScenario.expectedGoals
  };
  
  // Run test conversation
  // Validate MCP tool usage
  // Check goal extraction accuracy
  // Verify coaching quality
};

const testScenarios = {
  elena: {
    name: "Career Transition Discussion",
    userMessages: [
      "I'm thinking about transitioning from individual contributor to management",
      "I'm worried I don't have the right skills yet",
      "I want to work on my leadership presence and communication"
    ],
    expectedMCPCalls: [
      "get_user_graph",
      "search_nodes", 
      "create_node",
      "create_edge"
    ],
    expectedGoals: [
      {
        original_text: "transition from individual contributor to management",
        goal_category: "career",
        timeline: "medium_term"
      }
    ]
  },
  maya: {
    name: "Work-Life Balance Struggle",
    userMessages: [
      "I've been feeling overwhelmed lately",
      "I want to create better boundaries between work and personal time",
      "I'd like to start a morning mindfulness practice"
    ],
    expectedMCPCalls: [
      "get_user_graph",
      "search_nodes",
      "create_node"
    ],
    expectedGoals: [
      {
        original_text: "create better boundaries between work and personal time",
        goal_category: "personal",
        timeline: "short_term"
      }
    ]
  },
  sage: {
    name: "Learning New Programming Language", 
    userMessages: [
      "I want to learn Python for data analysis",
      "I've tried online courses before but struggled with consistency",
      "I need a better learning system"
    ],
    expectedMCPCalls: [
      "get_user_graph",
      "search_nodes",
      "create_node"
    ],
    expectedGoals: [
      {
        original_text: "learn Python for data analysis",
        goal_category: "learning",
        timeline: "medium_term"
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

## ðŸ“Š Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **Technical Performance:**
   - MCP tool success rate (should be >95%)
   - Webhook response times (<2 seconds)
   - Goal extraction accuracy (>90% of sessions should extract at least one goal)

2. **Coaching Quality:**
   - Average conversation length (target: 5-15 minutes)
   - User return rate (>60% within 7 days)
   - Goal progression tracking (goals updated in follow-up sessions)

3. **User Experience:**
   - Conversation satisfaction ratings
   - Time between sessions (shorter = more engaged)
   - Graph node creation rate (measure of insight generation)

### Monitoring Queries

```sql
-- Check recent coaching conversations
SELECT 
  ec.agent_id,
  ec.conversation_id,
  ec.analysis_data->>'User_Goals' as goals_extracted,
  ec.created_at,
  gn.label as created_nodes
FROM elevenlabs_conversations ec
LEFT JOIN graph_nodes gn ON gn.properties->>'conversation_id' = ec.conversation_id
WHERE ec.created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '24 hours'
ORDER BY ec.created_at DESC;

-- Check MCP tool usage patterns
SELECT 
  payload->>'tool_name' as tool,
  COUNT(*) as usage_count,
  AVG((payload->>'response_time')::numeric) as avg_response_time
FROM interaction_events 
WHERE event_type = 'mcp_tool_called'
  AND created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY payload->>'tool_name'
ORDER BY usage_count DESC;

-- Check goal extraction success rate
SELECT 
  agent_id,
  COUNT(*) as total_conversations,
  COUNT(CASE WHEN analysis_data ? 'User_Goals' THEN 1 END) as goals_extracted,
  ROUND(
    COUNT(CASE WHEN analysis_data ? 'User_Goals' THEN 1 END)::decimal / COUNT(*)::decimal * 100, 
    2
  ) as extraction_rate
FROM elevenlabs_conversations
WHERE created_at > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY agent_id;
```

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Issue: MCP Tools Not Being Called

**Symptoms:**
- Agent responses don't reference user history
- No new nodes being created in graph
- Generic responses without personalization

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Check MCP server logs: `supabase functions logs mcp-server --follow`
2. Verify MCP integration is enabled in ElevenLabs
3. Test MCP server directly with curl commands above
4. Check if user_id is being passed correctly

**Fix:**
```bash
# Test MCP server registration
curl https://hlwxmfwrksflvcacjafg.supabase.co/functions/v1/mcp-server/register

# Check agent MCP configuration in ElevenLabs dashboard
```

### Issue: No Goals Being Extracted

**Symptoms:**
- analysis_data field is empty in elevenlabs_conversations table
- No goal nodes being created after conversations
- Webhook receiving data but not processing goals

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Check webhook logs: `supabase functions logs elevenlabs-webhook --follow`
2. Verify Analysis tab configuration matches exactly
3. Test with simple goal statements during conversation
4. Check webhook secret configuration

**Fix:**
```javascript
// Test goal extraction with sample data
const testGoalExtraction = {
  analysis_data: {
    User_Goals: [
      {
        original_text: "I want to improve my leadership skills",
        goal_category: "career", 
        timeline: "medium_term",
        confidence_level: 0.8
      }
    ]
  }
};
```

### Issue: Agent Not Using Context Appropriately

**Symptoms:**
- Agent doesn't reference previous conversations
- Repetitive questions about basic information
- No connection between current and past discussions

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Verify get_user_graph is being called at conversation start
2. Check if user graph has data: `SELECT * FROM graph_nodes WHERE user_id = 'user-id'`
3. Test search_nodes functionality with sample queries
4. Review agent system prompt for context usage instructions

**Fix:**
- Ensure system prompt emphasizes MCP tool usage
- Add more explicit instructions for referencing user history
- Test with known user who has existing graph data

This implementation guide provides everything needed to set up sophisticated, context-aware coaching agents that leverage your LiveGuide knowledge graph effectively.
