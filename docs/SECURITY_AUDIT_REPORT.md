# Security Audit Report

## Date: July 31, 2025

## Executive Summary

A security audit was performed on the LiveGuide codebase to identify any exposed API keys, secrets, or sensitive information. **Critical security issues were found and immediately remediated.**

## Critical Findings (RESOLVED)

### 1. Hardcoded API Keys Found

**Severity: CRITICAL**

The following files contained hardcoded API keys:

1. **`./scripts/configure-agent-tools.ts`**
   - Line 5: ElevenLabs API key hardcoded as fallback
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Removed hardcoded key

2. **`./scripts/upload-knowledge-to-elevenlabs.ts`**
   - Line 7: ElevenLabs API key hardcoded as fallback
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Removed hardcoded key

3. **`./src/lib/elevenlabs-webhook.ts`**
   - Line 131: ElevenLabs webhook secret hardcoded as fallback
   - **Status**: ✅ FIXED - Removed hardcoded secret

### 2. Security Configuration

**`.gitignore` Status: ✅ PROPERLY CONFIGURED**
- All `.env*` files are ignored
- `.mcp.json` file (contains API keys) is ignored
- Node modules and build directories are ignored

**Git Repository Status: ✅ CLEAN**
- No `.env` files are tracked in git
- No sensitive files in git status

## Environment Files Found (Not in Git)

The following environment files exist locally but are properly ignored by git:
- `./.env.local`
- `./.env`
- `./.env.example`
- `./.env.local.example`
- `./supabase/.env`
- `./supabase/.env.local`
- `./supabase/.env.example`

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (COMPLETED)
1. ✅ Removed all hardcoded API keys and secrets
2. ✅ Verified `.gitignore` is properly configured
3. ✅ Confirmed no sensitive files in git

### Additional Security Measures

1. **Rotate Compromised Keys**
   - The exposed ElevenLabs API key should be rotated immediately
   - Generate new webhook secret for ElevenLabs
   - Update these values in your `.env.local` file

2. **Add Pre-commit Hooks**
   ```bash
   # Install pre-commit hook to scan for secrets
   npm install --save-dev @secretlint/secretlint-rule-preset-recommend
   ```

3. **Environment Variable Validation**
   - Add runtime checks to ensure required env vars are present
   - Fail fast if critical environment variables are missing

4. **Code Review Process**
   - Implement mandatory code review for any files touching authentication
   - Use automated secret scanning in CI/CD pipeline

5. **Add `.dockerignore`**
   ```
   # .dockerignore
   .env*
   .git
   node_modules
   .next
   *.log
   .DS_Store
   ```

## Audit Checklist

- [x] Scanned for hardcoded API keys
- [x] Verified `.gitignore` configuration
- [x] Checked for `.env` files in repository
- [x] Searched for common secret patterns
- [x] Verified no sensitive files in git
- [x] Removed all found hardcoded credentials
- [x] Created security documentation

## Conclusion

Critical security issues were identified and immediately remediated. The codebase no longer contains hardcoded API keys or secrets. However, the previously exposed keys should be rotated as they may have been committed to git history.

**Action Required**: Rotate the compromised ElevenLabs API key and webhook secret immediately.
