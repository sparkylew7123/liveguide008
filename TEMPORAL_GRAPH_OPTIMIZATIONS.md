# Temporal Graph Canvas Optimizations

## Overview
The `TemporalGraphCanvas.tsx` component has been completely optimized to address performance issues, enhance visual feedback, and improve the floating animation system.

## Key Optimizations Implemented

### 1. Fixed and Enhanced Floating Animation
- **Issue Fixed**: Animation was not running properly due to poor timing and RAF management
- **Solution**: Implemented sophisticated animation system with:
  - Frame-rate throttling based on performance mode (60fps/30fps)
  - Natural elliptical floating motion with varied phases and amplitudes
  - Proper cleanup and restart mechanisms
  - Animation pausing when tabs are hidden or during intensive operations

### 2. Improved Node and Edge Spacing
- **Enhanced Layout Algorithms**: Dynamic selection between fcose, cola, and cose layouts
- **Better Spacing Parameters**:
  - Node repulsion: 8000-10000 (prevents overlapping)
  - Ideal edge length: 120px (balanced connections)
  - Component spacing: 100-120px (separates disconnected components)
  - Smart padding and viewport management
- **Adaptive Layout**: Different algorithms for different graph sizes and change types

### 3. Enhanced Visual Feedback
- **Hover Effects**: Added smooth hover states for nodes and edges with overlay effects
- **Transition Animations**: All style changes use CSS transitions with performance-based timing
- **Visual Indicators**: Enhanced temporal effects including:
  - Pulsing for new nodes (< 1 hour old)
  - Glowing for recent nodes (< 24 hours old)
  - Fading for old nodes (gradually over 7 days)
  - Ghost preview for future nodes
- **Selection Feedback**: Enhanced selected state with glowing borders and smooth viewport centering

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- **Adaptive Performance Modes**: Automatically adjusts based on node count
  - High: < 100 nodes - Full animations and effects
  - Medium: 100-200 nodes - Reduced transitions
  - Low: > 200 nodes - Minimal animations
- **Efficient Batch Updates**: Smart batching with change detection
- **Memory Management**: Proper cleanup of animation frames and floating data
- **Throttled Updates**: Temporal effects update at appropriate intervals

### 5. Fixed Existing Issues

#### Floating Animation
- **Before**: Animation not visible, poor performance, interfered with interactions
- **After**: Smooth, natural floating motion that pauses during user interactions

#### Layout and Spacing
- **Before**: Overlapping nodes, poor component separation
- **After**: Well-spaced nodes, balanced layouts, proper viewport fitting

#### Temporal Effects
- **Before**: Basic aging with limited visual feedback
- **After**: Rich temporal effects with smooth transitions and proper timing

## Technical Improvements

### 1. Enhanced Color System
```typescript
// Adaptive colors for light/dark themes with better contrast
const typeColors: Record<string, { light: string; dark: string }> = {
  goal: { light: '#10b981', dark: '#34d399' },
  emotion: { light: '#f59e0b', dark: '#fbbf24' },
  // ... more types
};
```

### 2. Smart Animation System
```typescript
// Performance-aware animation with proper cleanup
const animate = () => {
  const currentTime = Date.now();
  if (currentTime - lastTime < frameInterval) return;
  
  // Natural floating motion with elliptical movement
  const xOffset = Math.sin(time + phase) * amplitude;
  const yOffset = Math.cos(time * 0.6 + phase) * (amplitude * 1.2);
};
```

### 3. Efficient Data Updates
```typescript
// Change detection prevents unnecessary updates
const hasChanged = Object.keys(element.data).some(key => 
  currentData[key] !== element.data[key]
);
```

### 4. Advanced Layout Selection
```typescript
// Chooses optimal layout based on graph characteristics
const layoutName = fcoseModule ? 'fcose' : colaModule ? 'cola' : 'cose';
```

## Performance Metrics

### Before Optimization
- Floating animation: Not working
- Large graphs (>100 nodes): Laggy interactions
- Layout: Poor spacing, overlapping nodes
- Temporal updates: Continuous expensive recalculations

### After Optimization
- Floating animation: Smooth 60fps on high-performance mode
- Large graphs: Responsive with adaptive performance scaling
- Layout: Well-balanced, non-overlapping nodes
- Temporal updates: Throttled and efficient

## Usage Notes

The component now automatically:
1. Detects graph size and adjusts performance mode
2. Provides smooth floating animations that don't interfere with interactions
3. Uses efficient batch updates for real-time data changes
4. Implements proper cleanup to prevent memory leaks
5. Adapts visual effects based on device capability

## Integration

The component maintains full backward compatibility while adding these enhancements:
- Same props interface
- Same event handling
- Enhanced visual feedback
- Better performance characteristics
