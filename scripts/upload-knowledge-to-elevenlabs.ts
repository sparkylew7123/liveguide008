    name: 'SMART Goals Framework',
    content: `SMART Goals Framework

SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. This framework helps create clear and attainable goals:

Specific: Your goal should be clear and specific. Ask yourself: What do I want to accomplish? Why is this goal important? Who is involved? Where is it located? Which resources are involved?

Measurable: Track your progress with concrete criteria. How much? How many? How will I know when it is accomplished?

Achievable: Your goal should be realistic and attainable. How can I accomplish this goal? How realistic is the goal based on constraints?

Relevant: Ensure the goal matters to you and aligns with other relevant goals. Does this seem worthwhile? Is this the right time? Does this match our other efforts/needs?

Time-bound: Every goal needs a target date. When? What can I do six months from now? What can I do six weeks from now? What can I do today?

Examples of SMART goals:
- "I will increase my monthly sales by 20% within the next 3 months by making 10 additional cold calls per day"
- "I will run a 5K race in under 30 minutes by training 4 times per week for the next 8 weeks"
- "I will save $5,000 for an emergency fund by saving $500 per month for the next 10 months"`

    content: `Effective Goal-Setting Conversation Guide

As a coach, use these techniques to help clients discover and refine their goals:

Opening Questions:
- "What would you like to achieve in the next 3-6 months?"
- "If you could change one thing about your life, what would it be?"
- "What does success look like to you?"

Clarifying Questions:
- "Can you tell me more about what that means to you?"
- "What specifically would be different if you achieved this?"
- "How would you know when you've reached this goal?"

Exploring Motivation:
- "Why is this goal important to you right now?"
- "What would achieving this allow you to do?"
- "How would reaching this goal impact other areas of your life?"

Identifying Obstacles:
- "What might get in the way of achieving this?"
- "What has stopped you from pursuing this before?"
- "What support would you need to succeed?"

Creating Action Steps:
- "What's one small step you could take this week?"
- "Who could help you with this goal?"
- "What resources do you already have available?"

Accountability Questions:
- "How would you like to track your progress?"
- "When should we check in on this goal?"
- "What would help you stay motivated?"

Remember: Listen more than you speak. Your role is to guide discovery, not provide answers.`
